# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```py
 L=[153,147,124,102] 
print(sum(L)))
```
## Output
![439296928-d732e3a8-dadb-4ab4-91c7-c4c18b31bd03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1d696a0-701e-4602-b9ad-da55fa2791b1)


## Result
Thus, the program has been executed successfully.
